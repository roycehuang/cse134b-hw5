The first change that I made, was to change the fundamental base of my CSS code, I created a general stylesheet `styles.css`, and I added any other specific styling a page required as a tag within their specified HTML, so it would be easy to change these factors in the future, and makes it easy to understand. In addition, I changed some styling in the footer to ensure that it stays at the bottom of the page, previously it was at the bottom of the content even when the content was less than a page long. In addition, I changed my theme toggle to be more minimalistic with just a circle.
